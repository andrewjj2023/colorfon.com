1. What is "Colorfon"?<br><br>

</p><p>
"COLORFON" is an experimental teaching system designed to help 
students of all ages improve their English promunciation.

2. Phonetics and Phonology.<br><br>

<p>
The difference between phonetics and phonology (Wikipedia)

</p><p>
Phonology concerns itself with systems of phonemes, abstract cognitive units of speech sound or sign 
which distinguish the words of a language. Phonetics, on the other hand, concerns itself with 
the production, transmission, and perception of the physical phenomena which are abstracted in the mind 
to constitute these speech sounds or signs.

3. A Short History.<br><br>
 </p><p> During the mid-eighties while I was teaching in Paris, I attended a 
course on "Phonetics" where I was introduced to an alternative method
of teaching English to foreign students.The originality of this method lay in its 
use of a coloured  phonetic alphabet as a substitute for traditional written English. 
As a result of this seminare, 
I started using it in my evening classes. 
 </p><p>
The first few lessons were focused on 
learning this new phonetic alphabet. This was fun for the kids because instead of 
the usual matching-up of words and pictures, they got the permission to try out all 
kinds of funny noises, getting a lot of attention and laughter all round. 
I turned this chaos into an organised game and it worked: most of them learnt most of 
the sounds and colours in a very short time. As the lessons evolved however, and 
longer words 
and sentences were introduced, I became aware that the very sounds that were the 
foundations of
the lessons were slowly getting forgotten. I introduced the same material to other 
groups of students and witnessed the same thing.

 </p><p>
The experiment came slowly to an 
end. But not without having had it's effect on me. In a short space of time,
I had learnt something very immportant: that there could be other ways to improve pronunciation 
which did not rely on rules and memory alone.

 </p>
To cut a long story short, I came to the conclusion that teaching 
English Language and pronunciation contemporarily is not as straight-forward as it seems.
 I know that there are talented teachers out there who are convinced of the 
contrary and Iìm sure achieve great satisfaction and results, but

I believe that it is a reality that the great majority of students do not have 
access to such privilegged instruction, and consequently pronunciation is left as "an option" 
and for the most, neglected conpletely.

 </p><p>
This situation seemed to me unacceptable. At the same time knowing that I wasn´t the first one to 
discover the biggest fault in second-language learning, I was absolutely sure that there was 
more room, lots more room, to improve it. So I decided to concentrate my efforts on finding out more 
about where the problem lay exactly.

 </p><p>

This conclusion was the starting point on 
a long road that would open up a world that not only I was not prepared or trained for,
but would occupy far more of my time and mental energy than I could possibly have 
immagined.

 </p><p>
My very first action was to find out more about phonetics, phonetic methods and teaching practices in the classroom.
As I did so, I made notes on what I thought could be improved. I made modifications to some methods and completely 
transformed others. I spent a long time experimenting with new ideas and playing around with old ones, 
 but was never really happy with the result. I decided one day 
to write down a list of "requirements" that satisfied my idea of an ideal system. The result was the following:-


 </p><p>


<ol>
<li>that colour must play a leading role.</li>
<li> that the graphics must be so minimalistic as to be the epitomy of simplicity.
<li> that the graphic images of the vowels be immediately and inequivocably recognizable as sounds(FONS) and not letters(CONS). </li>
<li> that the colours be reduced to the 6 primary and secondary.</li>
<li> that all sounds must correspond to those of the IPA (International Phonetic Association).</li>
<li> just as colour is an essential factor so must interactivity be fundamental for prolonged participartion.
</li> 
<li> that it must be intuitive; giving students the autonomy to act alone, make decisions, make mistakes 
and make ammends, consequently becoming responsible for their own progress and, being aware of it, boosting self-esteem</li> 
<li> that it must be self-stimulating , so that there is no need for encouragement or supervision,
 which means they can play away from any sort of controlled envoirenment.
Using the above list as my bible, I set about creating something new, from scratch. 
</p><p>
It took several years (teaching had become a secondary activity) before I had a valid 
experimental system ready. I used it in the beginning in evening classes for children who were 
unable to attend English lessons at daytime school. It is because of these children's 
enthusiasm and that of their parents
that I decided then to dedicate more time and research to developing this new system.
"Colorfon" was born. 
</p><p>
I was now settled in Italy. Teaching no longer being my principle activity, it took a long 
time and many trials, experimental classes and constant interuptions before I was organized 
enough to begin using computers as a media for teaching Colorfon in my classes. The success
 of these lessons over only a short period convinced me to take the next step. A big step.
 Take Colorfon to a larger public.

I am no programmer, and have no formal skills in 
computer languages or website building. Everything displayed on the following pages is the fruit of 
patient code-manipulation, ceaseless trial and error, and countless modifications of other peoples

is full of websites where people freely share their know-how and expertise to help others like me 
who do not have the time nor inclination to become MASTERS of WEB CODE LANGUAGES.
Without their contribution this site would not exist. I thank them all!

5. Who is Colorfon for?<br><br>
 </p><p>
  Whether you are student, teacher, school kid or retired university professor; 
 Colofon will surprise you. Some people will be daunted by it's apparent "complexity", but I am 
 convinced that as you become familiar with it, you will acknowledge it's simplicity and 
 effectivness. Colorfon will grow on you; of that I am sure.

</p><p>
 I also believe that anything that attempts to do things in a un-usual way stimulates the brain, 
 and we can all use that. So, who is Colorfon for? The answer is ..."Everyone who is curious 
 enough to try it!"

6. Why are some people "better" than others at learning?<br><br>
 </p><p>
There is no quick answer to that, so I won't bore you with my own personal theories.I  
don't find learning languages particularly easy myself and may be one of the reasons why I sympathise
with those with the same problem.
What I do understand is that no two people learn anything in quite the same way, and in my 
opinion only a SMALL PART of any given population are able to take full advantage of a 
system that does not take this into account.
</p><p>
 In an ideal world, and perhaps in a not-too-distant future, every student will have his/her OWN 
personal programme suited to their individual level/capability/tendency. Because this is not
so, there is an enormous percentage of potential learners who are left out of the "privileged" 
and, not surprisingly, "successful" mainstream. This huge slice of mankind is left to stew in it's
own juice. And most individuals do just that. And because there is no glue that binds them, 
no union to join and no valid alternative, people are left alone with the misplaced idea that 
their insuccess has something to do with an inherent cognitive disability rather than a grossly
defective sorting system hovering over their heads.

6a. A personal experience.<br><br>
 </p><p>
The following is an example of how one individual clearly demonstrated his own disapproval
of my teaching methods.  
 </p><p>
Mateo was a healthy, spright, eight-year-old in one of my first computer classes.
Although at first a little introvert, but at the same 
capable of bursts of usually-distruptive super-activity, he surprisingly distinguished himself 
(to my great satifaction) as being equally competent, albeit taking a little longer than the 
rest of the class, in the completing of the preliminary exercises. 
After compliments and back-slapping allround at 
achieving success at our first computer experience together,  
we moved on to the next stage of the programme, to which the other children immediately 
attacked with enthusiasm. To my great surprise(again) and disappointment, Mateo, no longer 
in the mood to concentrate, sprang up from his desk and, finding a football  in the corner of 
the 
classroom(silly me!), and to the boistrous approval of his classmates, began a furious one-man 
football 
match with one of the classroom walls as opponent. Completely oblivious to me and my persusive 
attempts (trying hard not to lose my temper in front of a new class but at the same time aware 
of the general
pandimonium that could ensue if I was too lenient), Mateo showed no intention of stopping 
his one-man show. I decided to act. I picked up his football and put it high up on a shelf 
where he couldn't reach it. He sulked for a while in a spare desk at the back of the class, 
and then came back to his own. After a little hesitation, he started moving the mouse. 
I couldn't see what he was doing from where I was standing, but, more than satisfied with 
having him back with us, left him alone. He was so absorbed with what he was doing that in the end, 
my curiosity got the better of me so and I went over to his desk. He was repeating the original
exercise! And when he had finished, he started over again! He was simply doing what he was good at!	
This may seen a mundane example, but it opened my eyes to the fact that, although refusing to 
colaborate with me by following MY programme, he had in fact invented a way of participating 
by doing what HE wanted to do! And he was enjoying every minute of it! From then on, I gave him 
freedom to choose his own agenda, realizing that his continued presence in my class depended on 
the satisfaction HE got from being successful. This experience and others like it have 
convinced me that the success of a good experimental exercise depended on the constructors ability to 
combine eficiency with attractive presentation: that means fun for EVERYONE!


 </p><p>
 The conclusion to this anecdote 
is that although we all understand that everybody learns better when they enjoy what they are 
doing, enthusiastic teacher will be surprised more often and perhaps learn something useful too
if their pupils get the opportunity to take part in the decision-making.
Of course, it's not always easy to apply this when you have to keep-up with standard instituitional
programmes, but, methods CAN be improved upon, and MUST be if educational equality is a priority.
Educational equality in terms of the individual's right to explore rather than a fight against social injustice.

</p><p>
The point to this longer-than-intended monologue is that there is a great majority of us
that are judged by those in authority by what we cannot do instead of by  
what each of us ENJOYS doing.
Every child (especially those with apparant "difficulties"), should be considered as a 
completely functional and "smart" human being, and that they are each capable of MUCH, MUCH 
more than we believe them to be. That it is only us, as adults, that are limited in our 
assessment of them.

</p><p>

Given the right envoironment, they can fly too. Colorfon is dedicated to them.

7. Why isn't everybody "good" learn a language using existing traditional methods? <br><br>
 </p><p>
 The drawback with learning a non-phonetical language 
such as English-as-a-Second-Language(ESL) becomes apparent(for some) when students have little or no
 access to 
a native speaker who can act as as mediator between them and spoken speech. Every serious language 
institute has it's own audio-visual lab and there are numerous on-line courses that include the 
same kind of speech training, mostly by the listen-and-repeat method. This has been and still is 
perhaps the only valid way to practice spoken English in a non-English speaking envoirenment. 
You have to be motivated, consistant and a very patient and practiced self-learner in order to 
obtain satisfactory, permanant results. Unfortunately, not everybody is. A lot of students 
(that means anyone who is attempting to learn anything), for an infinite of reasons, just don't have 
the determination, 
concentration, and whatever else it takes, to volutarily undertake a task that they(the students)
 are specifically not obligated to do. So if they can avoid it, they will. Unless they happen to be 
 enjoyable, fun, exciting, rewarding! That's not easy to accomplish, but I think it can be done.

8. What makes Colorfon different?<br><br>
 </p><p>
How The Colorfon Alphabet differs from the IPA is immediately evident by it's use of 
colour. This for two reasons. One is because colour is naturally attractive to everyone. 
That means it draws attention. A good starting point, especially for children. The second is 
that colours (there are 7) can be 
used as the common denominators(families) for all it's family members, with each member(FON9
having a specific "role" within the family; while at the same time sharing the same 
"styling" with members of the other families in a kind of sound spectrum. This division into 
families is the underlying(and possibly controversial) feature of Colorfon, and is 
responsible for it's originality and simplicity.

 </p><p> I mentioned "styling".There are just 2 "styles".
and 2 add-on sound extensions or "dipthongs", so, in all, there is a total of just 9 sound-symbol
associations that have to be learnt in Colorfon, and they are made easier to remember by a 
convenient colour-identification system. 
The other fundamental characteristic of Colorfon is the deliberate 
choise of ONLY English-Alphabet letters for the CONS; this allows for an immediate VISUAL 
distinction from tha coloured FONS, with the result that reading is accurate and faster.

8a.  What can colorfon do?<br><br>
 </p><p>
In the context of learning a second language,   
many adults lament that they cannot "remember" how a word is pronounced, even though they have
heard the word perhaps hundreds of times. These people and a great number like them 
(me included) are deficient in "auditory" memory: our brain have a problem "registering" the 
"sound" associated with any given spoken word. 
Although Colorfon has no magic wand that eliminates or
reduces spelling rules, it by-passes the need to remember  
how any word is pronounced.
</p><p>
 The basic principles behind "COLORFON" are simple and well-known in the field of 
linguistics and can be summed-up in one word. "Phonology": a lot of people prefer to use the term
 "Phonetics". 
</p><p>Now we don't have to study or know anything about phonology or phonetics to use COLORFON: 
They are simply the technical terms for the study and production of "sounds" in speech. Now in order to analyse 
this phenomena, we have to "breakdown" the audible output that any given speaker produces. An abstract 
flow of contiuous "noise" must be converted into manageable and tangible units of individual 
sounds. That may seem an almost impossible task at first sight, considering the fact that no 
two people's voices are the same and there are many many people on this planet! 
Instead of writing words as a group of individual letters chosen 
one by one from the alphabet, it takes the "sound ", or collection of "sounds" that you 
actually hear when words are spoken, and then represents 
them visually(on the screen in our case!).</p><p>The "concept" of sound-symbol association is 
thousands of years old, 
so COLORFON has invented nothing new! What it attempts to do is, with the help of the almighty 
PC, is to update, refresh and perhaps 
stir new enthusiasm for what is the Archille's heel in many methods of learning English. 
PRONUNCIATION. 

The "sounds" or "phonemes" (as ufficially called) that are used by COLORFON are a replica of
 those in the "IPA" 
(International Phonetic Alphabet).

9. Is there a "downside" to Colorfon? <br><br>
 </p><p>
Colorfon does not help you with your spelling; neither can it teach you grammar, at least not in
this early stage. There are many, many good institutes, books and websites that teach the 
English Language through traditional methods, and these are the obvious roads to follow
if you need a thorough and complete  
 preparation, especially if you intend to sit 
any kind of official examinations.

 </p><p>
The beauty with Phonology lies within it's attempt to breakdown speech 
into separate units of sounds(PHONEMES); each one, unique and repeatable. Because it 
deals with human sound output, and since no two people have the same speech characteristics,
the application of phonetics is an inexact science. Nonetheless, in the name of clarity 
and classification, an international, authoritive and academic body, founded over a century 
ago in Paris, created the International Phonetic Alphabet(IPA), a complete table of PHONEMES 
that the human vocal chords are capable of producing, and represented these sounds
as unequivocal graphical characters, numbering over 160. Any one language will only use a 
fraction of these. Conventional English Language Establishments require the use of about 
44 PHONEMES. Colorfon operates with 42.

11. Is Colorfon difficult?<br><br>
 </p><p>
My hope and intention with Colorfon has always been that everyone who is interested will 
discover that Colorfon is genuinely effective in improving pronunciation.  
As I mentioned earlier, everybody learns differently, and this intends also the RATE at which 
we learn. Children are obviously the best learners, and naturally pick-up Colorfon 
quicker than adults do. But Colorfon is intended for everyone. Children are driven by 
challenge: adults are driven by motivation. Even with the handicap 
of age, earnest and mature grown-ups can be incentivated with the fact of having learnt the 
advantage of being constant. If you possess 
 some of these qualities and are prepared to listen carefully and
follow the instructions designated to each exercise, there is no reason why Colorfon 
should be difficult. In the end, it is all a question of time, and energy. 
 It's an old story : but the more of these you have at your disposition, the greater chance you will 
have of succeeding.

</p><p>
With the Colorfon website, I have tried to create an 
interface that is esthetically attractive, easy-to-use, and which requires few 
instructions, and (for small children) a minimum of supervision. I know that it can be 
improved. It's mainly up to you, the actors in this show, to let me know how. 
They call it FEEDBACK, and anyone can get in touch with me through the CONTACT page.

12. A word on claims and inventions.<br><br>
 </p><p>
The very first language to be 
written down (in ancient Egypt)I understand, was composed of a mixture of symbols and 
familiar creatures and objects from everyday life. Recycling the world around you transforming it into a durable heritage. 
In the same way, Colorfon is no more 
than recycling. because it uses colours and letters familiar to all. No-one invents 
anything. Most of the time, we human beings only make use what is already there. Sometimes it is just below the surface, and 
sometimes it lies further down: but it's there. And anyone can take it, however difficult and distant away 
it may seem at first sight. 
Immagination, creativity, tons of patience and a pinch of faith are the qualities 
necessary before 
reaching the final goal, but human beings have potentially illimited quantities of all of 
these (It's an injustice that most of us haven't had the opportunity to practice them). 

</p><p>
The process may take longer than you expect; but that's part of the parcel. 
The aquisition of Knowledge can be seen as 
the result of balancing Action with Reflection. Knowing what to do and when to do it. 
Knowledge becomes Art. And you become the Artist.

<\p><p>
 Good luck to all who experiment and innovate.

13. Conclusion.<br><br>
 </p><p>
 What I have accomplished in publishing this website is to
construct the presentation of an idea. It is an experimental platform in it's very first stage 
of develepment as yet an untested learning tool. It is only an introduction
to a system and it's symbols, which, even in this limited presentation, 
gives the opportunity to anyone to get an insight into the Colorfon language
and at the same time evaluate it's usefullness. 

</p><p>
Colorfon does not help children to read. And is not intended as an aid to infants 
learning their mother tongue. It is not the final step to mastering a language either. 


</p><p>
Just as Phonology is an inexact science, so Colorfon, 
as one of it's many siblings, has it's imperfections.
But within the boundaries of limitation, Colorfon might be an immportant solution to pronunuciation
problems that many second language students encounter, especially those who are self-learners
and have little or no access to native English speakers. I hope it will help some to regain lost enthusiasm
and assure others who doubt their own ability, to understand that they CAN, with their own determination and 
vision, achieve and succeed in what may have seemed a lost battle.


</p><p>
Any critisism, constructive or not, will be gratefully considered, especially from acedemics 
and professionals who work in the same field.

</p><p>
Colorfon doesn't claim to be a teaching method. It is simply a phono-graphical
transcription of standard written English that has proved helpful 
to many students over the years in improving their pronunciation. More than help them, these 
classes gave me a unique possibility to test, develope and modify Colorfon to it's present
"condition". I am indebted to them for being the guinea pigs of this experiment.

14. Next.<br><br>
 </p><p>
 The next page introduces the colorfon Alphabet. It is about Bricks 
and Mortar. The Mortar represents the FONS, which are the elegant and coloured "rondals"
each with their own distinct and inconfutable sound. They are the organizers; 
they dictate the orders that bring and keep the Bricks together. 
They represent the Soul of the 
alphabet. Charismatic and induscutibly in command, they are The Mind: 
they are the Masters.

</p><p>
The Bricks represent the CONS. The white soldiers that can hardly stand up alone 
without falling over. They are the bones of the language, the slaves, the hard stuff. 
left by themselves they have no identity, no meaning, no mission. Obediently bent 
into submission by their masters, but also their brothers in arms. 
That, harnessed beautifully and intrinsicly together, breath life and meaning 
into an endless stream of apparently disordered utterances
 to proclaim the finished masterpiece:  

</p><p>
SPEECH.</P> With proper use we can deside our destiny. Abusing it we have 
no choice but to lose.
