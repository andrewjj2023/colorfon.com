1. What is "Colorfon"?<br>

<P>"COLORFON" is an experimental teaching system designed to help 
students of all ages improve their English promunciation. </p>

<br>



<p>

2. Phonetics and Phonology.<br>

</p><p>
Phonology concerns itself with systems of phonemes, abstract cognitive units of speech sound or sign 
which distinguish the words of a language. Phonetics, on the other hand, concerns itself with 
the production, transmission, and perception of the physical phenomena which are abstracted in the mind 
to constitute these speech sounds or signs.

<br>




</p><p>


3. A Short History.<br>
 </p><p> During the mid-eighties while I was teaching in Paris, I attended a 
course on "Phonetics" where I was introduced to an alternative method
of teaching English to foreign students.The originality of this method lay in its 
use of a coloured  phonetic alphabet as a substitute for traditional written English. 
As a result of this seminare, 
I started using it in my evening classes. 
 </p><p>
The first few lessons were focused on 
learning this new phonetic alphabet. This was fun for the kids because instead of 
the usual matching-up of words and pictures, they got the permission to try out all 
kinds of funny noises, getting a lot of attention and laughter all round. 
I turned this chaos into an organised game and it worked: most of them learnt most of 
the sounds and colours in a very short time. As the lessons evolved however, and 
longer words 
and sentences were introduced, I became aware that the very sounds that were the 
foundations of
the lessons were slowly getting forgotten. I introduced the same material to other 
groups of students and witnessed the same thing.



























2. A Short History.
<p> During the mid-eighties when I was teaching in Paris, I attended a course on "Phonetics" and
was introduced to "The Silent Way", an alternative, and (seemed to me), revolutionary method
of teaching English in the classroom. Full of enthusiasm as a result of this seminare, a few 
colleagues and myself, armed with the necessary Silent Way teaching materials, began using 
it our classes. Although excited at first at this new approach to teaching English, we soon 
discovered that it had it's drawbacks. Although I found the philosophy of The Silent Way to be 
inspiring, the layout of so many symbols and colours were daunting to most students. I soon set 
about thinking of ways to changed them. It took several years before I had a valid experimental 
alternative to the Silent Way system and began using it in evening classes for children who were 
unable to attend English lessons at school. It is because of their enthusiasm and that of their 
parents
that I decided then to dedicate more time and research to developing this new system. The 
resulting product of this work no longer bore any resemblence to "The Silent Way", so it merited 
a name: "Colorfon" was born. 
I was now settled in Italy. Teaching no longer being my principle activity, it took a long 
time and many trials, experimental classes and constant interuptions before I was organized 
enough to begin using computers as a media for teaching Colorfon in my classes. The success
 of these lessons over only a short period convinced me to take the next step. A big step.
 Take Colorfon to a larger public. 
 
3. Phonetics and Phonology.
 
3. The website.
I am no programmer, and have no formal skills in 
computer languages or website building. Everything displayed on the following pages is the fruit of 
patient code-manipulation, ceaseless trial and error, and countless modifications. The internet today 
is full of websites where people freely share their know-how and expertise to help others. 
Without their generosity this site would not exist. I thank them all!
The result of this joint effort is the Colofon website.

4. Who is Colorfon for?
  Whether you are student, teacher, school kid or retired university professor; 
 Colofon will surprise you. Some people will be daunted by it's apparent complexity, but I am 
 convinced that as you become familiar with it, you will acknowledge it's simplicity and 
 effectiveness. Colorfon will grow on you; of that I am sure.
 I also believe that anything that attempts to do things in a un-usual way stimulates the brain, 
 and we can all use that. So, who is Colorfon for? The answer is ..."everyone who is curious 
 enough to try it!"
 </p>
<p>

5. What is the "downside" to Colorfon?
Colorfon does not help you with your spelling; neither can it teach you grammar, at least not in
this early stage. There are many, many good institutes, books and websites that teach the 
English Language through traditional methods, and these are the obvious roads to choose from
if you need a profound, complete and professional result, especially if you intend to sit 
any kind of official examinations.

6. Why are some people "better" than others at learning?
There is no quick answer to that, so I won't try.I  
don't find studying particularly easy myself and may be one of the reasons why I sympathise
with those with the same problem.
What I do understand is that no two people learn anything in quite the same way, and in my 
opinion only a SMALL PART of any given population are able to take FULL advantage of a 
system that does not take this into account.
 In an ideal world, every student would have his/her OWN 
personal programme suited to their individual level/capability/tendency. Because this is not
so, there is an enormous percentage of potential learners who are left out of the "privileged" 
an, not surprisingly, "successful" mainstream. This huge slice of mankind is left to stew in it's
own juice. And most individuals do just that. And because there is no glue that binds them, 
no union to join and no valid alternative, people are left alone with the misplaced idea that 
their insuccess has something to do with an inherent cognitive disability rather than a grossly
defective sorting system hovering over their heads. 
 
7. A personal experience.
The following is an example of how one individual clearly demonstrated his own disapproval
of my teaching methods.  
Mateo was a healthy, spright, eight-year-old in one of my first computer classes.
Although at first a little introvert, but at the same 
capable of bursts of usually-distruptive super-activity, he surprisingly distinguished himself 
(to my great satifaction) as being equally competent, albeit taking a little longer than the 
rest of the class, in the completing of the preliminary exercises. 
After compliments and back-slapping allround at 
achieving success at our first computer experience together,  
we moved on to the next stage of the programme, to which the other children immediately 
attacked with enthusiasm. To my great surprise(again) and disappointment, Mateo, no longer 
in the mood to concentrate, sprang up from his desk and, finding a football  in the corner of 
the 
classroom(silly me!), and to the boistrous approval of his classmates, began a furious one-man 
football 
match, with one of the classroom walls as opponent. Completely oblivious to me and my persusive 
attempts (trying hard not to lose my temper in front of a new class but at the same time aware 
of the general
pandimonium that could ensue if I was too lenient), Mateo showed no intention of stopping 
his one-man show. I decided to act. I picked up his football and put it high up on a shelf 
where he couldn't reach it. He sulked for a while in a spare desk at the back of the class, 
and then came back to his own. After a little hesitation, he started moving the mouse. 
I couldn't see what he was doing from where I was standing, but, more than satisfied with 
having him back with us, left him alone. He was so absorbed with what he was doing that in the end, 
my curiosity got the better of me so and I went over to his desk. He was repeating the original
exercise! And when he had finished, he started over again! He was simply doing what he was good at!	
This may seen a mundane example, but it opened my eyes to the fact that, although refusing to 
colaborate with me by following MY programme, he had in fact invented a way of participating 
by doing what HE wanted to do! And he was enjoying every minute of it! From then on, I gave him 
freedom to choose his own itinery, realizing that his continued presence in my class depended on 
the satisfaction he got from being successful. This experience and others like it have 
convinced me that the construction of a good E-learning programme depended on my ability to 
combine of on the quality of creative presentation. 
 The conclusion to this anecdote 
is that although we all understand that everybody learns better when they enjoy what they are 
doing, enthusiastic teacher will be surprised more often and perhaps learn something useful too
if their pupils get the opportunity to take part in the decision-making.
Of course, it's not always easy to apply this when you have to keep-up with standard instituitional
programmes, but, methods CAN be improved upon, and MUST be if educational equality is a priority.
Educational equality in terms of indiviual exploration rather than of social injustice.

The point to this longer-than-intended paragraph is that there is a great majority of us
that are judged by those in authority by what we cannot do instead of by  
what each of us ENJOYS doing.
Every child (especially those with apparant "difficulties"), should be considered as a 
completely functional and "smart" human being, and that they are each capable of MUCH, MUCH 
more than we believe them to be. That it is only us, as adults, that are limited in our 
assessment of them.
Given the right envoironment, they can fly too. Colorfon is dedicated to them.



7. Why isn't everybody "good" learn a language using existing traditional methods? 
 The drawback with learning a non-phonetical language 
such as English-as-a-Second-Language(ESL) becomes apparent(for some) when students have little or no
 access to 
a native speaker who can act as as mediator between them and spoken speech. Every serious language 
institute has it's own audio-visual lab and there are numerous on-line courses that include the 
same kind of speech training, mostly by the listen-and-repeat method. This has been and still is 
perhaps the only valid way to practice spoken English in a non-English speaking envoirenment. 
You have to be motivated, consistant and a very patient and practiced self-learner in order to 
obtain satisfactory, permanant results. Unfortunately, not everybody is. A lot of students 
(that means anyone who is attempting to learn anything), for an infinite of reasons that go 
beyond the scope of this text, just don't have the determination, 
concentration and whatever else it takes, to volutarily undertake a task that they(the students)
 are 
specifically not obligated to do. So they don't. Unless they happen to be enjoyable, fun,
 exciting. That's not easy to accomplish, but I think it can be done.
 
 What can colorfon do?
In the context of learning a second language,   
many adults moan that they cannot "remember" how a word is pronounced, even though they have
heard the word perhaps hundreds of times. These people and a great number like them 
(me included) are deficient in AUDITORY memory: their brain has a problem "registering" the 
"sound" associated with any given spoken word. Even if they are, it usually means that you 
accept your limitations and thus stop trying 
Although Colorfon has no magic wand that 
reduces spelling rules, it eliminates the need to remember  
pronunciation 



The IPA.
The beauty with Phonetics lies within it's attempt to breakdown speech 
into separate units of sounds(PHONEMES); each one, unique and repeatable. Because phonetics 
deals with human sound output, and since no two people have the same speech characteristics,
the application of phonetics is an inexact science. Nonetheless, in the name of clarity 
and classification, an international, authoritive and academic body, founded over a century 
ago in Paris, created the International Phonetic Alphabet(IPA), a complete table of PHONEMES 
that the human vocal chords are capable of producing, and represented these sounds
as unequivocal graphical characters, numbering over 160. Any one language will only use a 
fraction of these. Conventional English Language Establishments require the use of about 
44 PHONEMES. Colorfon operates with 42. 


8. What makes Colorfon different?
How The Colorfon Alphabet differs from the IPA is immediately evident by it's use of 
colour. This for two reasons. One is because colour is naturally attractive to everyone. 
That means it draws attention. A good starting point, especially for children. The second is 
that colours (there are 7) can be 
used as the common denominators(families) for all it's family members, with each member(FON9
having a specific "role" within the family; while at the same time sharing the same 
"styling" with members of the other families in "The Sound Spectrum". This division into 
families is the underlying(and possibly controversial) feature of Colorfon, and is 
responsible for it's originality and simplicity. I mentioned "styling".There are just 2 "styles".
and 2 "add-on sound extensions"(DIPHTHONGS), so, in all, there is a total of just 9 sound-symbol
associations that have to be learnt in Colorfon, and they are made easier to remember by a 
convenient colour-identification system. 
The other fundamental characteristic of Colorfon is the deliberate 
choise of ONLY English-Alphabet letters for the CONSONS; this allows for an immediate VISUAL 
distinction from tha coloured FONEMS, with the result that reading is accurate and faster.



5. Is Colorfon difficult?
My hope and intention with Colorfon has always been that everyone who is interested will 
discover that Colorfon is genuinely effective in improving pronunciation.  
As I mentioned earlier, everybody learns differently, and this intends also the RATE at which 
we learn. Children are obviously the best learners, and naturally pick-up Colorfon 
quicker than adults do. But Colorfon is intended for everyone. Children are driven by 
challenge: adults are driven by motivation. Even with the handicap 
of age, earnest and mature grown-ups can be incentivated with the fact of having learntg the 
advantage of being constant. If you possess just some of these qualities and are prepared to
follow the instructions designated to each exercise, then there is no reason why Colorfon 
should be difficult. In the end, it is all a question of time. 
The more time you have at your disposition to dedicate to it, the greater chance you will 
have of succeeding.
With the Colorfon website, I have tried to create an 
interface that is esthetically attractive, easy-to-use, and which requires few 
instructions, and (for small children) a minimum of supervision. I know that it can be 
improved. It's mainly up to YOU, the actors in this show, to let me know HOW. 
They call it FEEDBACK.


 

produce word-transcriptions or "WORDIMS" as I call them, 

to has the mortar from the 
bricks, the skin from the bones, the FONEMS from the CONSONS.




9. Conclusion.
 What I have accomplished in publishing this website is to
construct the presentation of an idea. It is an experimental platform in it's very first stage 
of develepment as a yet-untested learning tool. It is only, as yet, an introduction
to a system and it's symbols, which, even in this limited presentation, 
gives the opportunity to anyone to get an insight, hands-on, into the Colorfon "language" 
and at the same time perhaps, evaluate it's usefullness. 


Colorfon does not help children to read. And is not intended as an aid to infants 
learning their mother tongue. It is not the final step to mastering a language either. 



Just as Phonetics is an inexact science, so Colorfon, 
as one of it's many chidren, has it's imperfections.
But within the boundaries of limitation, Colorfon might be an immportant solution to pronunuciation
problems that many second language students encounter, especially those who are self-learners
and have little or no access to English speakers. I hope it will help some to regain lost enthusiasm
assure those who 
doubt their 
ability, to understand that they CAN, with the right assistance, 

.. and encourage others to continue in what may seem a lost battle.


Having only a basic(TEFL) qualification in enlish language instruction, 
any critisism, constructive or not, will be gratefully considered, especially from acedemics 
and professionals in the same area of research.


Colorfon doesn't claim to be a teaching method. It is simply a phono-graphical
transcription of standard written English that has proved helpful 
to many students over the years in improving their pronunciation. More than help THEM, these 
classes gave me a unique possibility to test, develope and modify Colorfon to it's present
"condition". I am indebted to them for being the guinea pigs of this experiment.


 10. A word on claims and inventions.
The very first language to be 
written down (in ancient Egypt)I undeerstand, was composed of a mixture of phonetic symbols and 
familiar creatures and objects from everyday life. So in away, Colorfon is recycling. No-one invents 
anything. We only discover what is already there. Sometimes it is just below the surface, and 
sometimes it lies further down. But it's there. And anyone can take it, however far down it
may be, and use; adapt it.
The process may take longer than you expect; but that's part of the parcel. Knowledge is simply
the art of balancing Action with Patience. Knowing when to do, and when not to do. Good luck to 
all who dabble with inovations.


It's also a game for kids who want to test themselves: a challenge for curious adults: a pastime for 





</p><p> The basic principles behind "COLORFON" are simple and well-known in the field of 
linguistics and can be summed-up in one word. "Phonology": some people prefer to use the term
 "Phonetics". 
</p><p>Now we don't have to study or know anything about phonology or phonetics to use COLORFON: 
They are simply the technical terms for the study of "sound" in speech. Now in order to analyse 
this phenomena, we have to "breakdown" the audible output that given speaker produces. An abstract 
flow of contiuous "noise" must be converted into managable and tangible units of individual 
sounds. That may seem an almost impossible task at first sight, considering the fact that no 
two people's voices are the same and there are many many people on this planet! 
Instead of writing words as a group of individual letters chosen 
one by one from the alphabet, it takes the "sound ", or collection of "sounds" that you 
actually hear when words are spoken, and then represents 
them visually(on the screen in our case!).</p><p>The "concept" of sound-symbol association is 
thousands of years old, 
so COLORFON has invented nothing new! What it attempts to do is, with the help of the almighty 
PC, is to update, refresh and perhaps 
stir new enthusiasm for what is the Archille's heel in many methods of learning English. 
Pronunciation. 

The "sounds" or "phonemes" (as ufficially called) that are used by COLORFON are a replica of
 those in the "IPA" 
(International Phonetic Alphabet).

The letters of the English alphabet can be split into 2 distinct groups, 
i.e. Vowels and Consonants.
